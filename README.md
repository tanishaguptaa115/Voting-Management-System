# Voting System Project

This is a simple console-based Voting System implemented in **Java**. It allows registered voters to cast their votes, and administrators can log in to view the voter list, candidate profiles, and election results.

---
## Features
- **Voting Process**: Voters can cast their votes using either the candidate's name or emoji symbol.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators can log in to view the list of voters, candidate profiles, and the current election results.
- **Validation**: Ensures only eligible voters (age 18+) can vote. Prevents multiple voting attempts.
- **Candidate Profiles**: Displays candidate information using emoji symbols.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- IDE or command line with Java support

## Project Structure
- `votingsystem6.java`: Main Java file containing the implementation.
- Data is stored using `HashMap` collections.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Compile the program using the following command:
    ```bash
    javac votingsystem6.java
    ```
3. Run the program using:
